## Errata

Page 31: The technical requirement section requires the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit be added as a NuGet package.

Page 36(line 11):You should use chain UseMauiCommunityToolkitMarkup to UseMauiCommunityToolkit in the builder [1]."
There is no bracketed 1, i.e. [1], in the code section directly preceding this sentence.

Page 36(line 18):new Entry().Size(400,40); it should be 400 instead of 200

Page 39: Setting up MVMM should be Setting up MVVM

Page 11 : Chapter 1 - The sentence,**"Right now, let’s open this out of the box project."** is incorrect. It _should be_ **"Right now, let’s open MauiProgram.cs"**

Page 47: Chapter 4- The sentence, **“Add an attribute above the [ObservableObject] class declaration like this:”** is incorrect. It _should be_ **"Add the [ObservableObject] attribute above the MainViewModel class declaration like this”**

Page 59 : Chapter 4- Minor correction: All occurrences of **GestureRecognizer** _should be_ **GestureRecognizers**

Page 76 : Chapter 4 - The sentence, **"To keep things clean, remove the Editor and its associated Label from LoginPage.xaml and remove the constructor and ICommand from ViewModel.** is incorrect. It _should be_ **"To keep things clean, remove the Editor and its associated Label from LoginPage.xaml."**
